## ðŸ“– Overview  
This project is a **scalable network simulator** that models communication between thousands of **wireless sensors** using **TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)** and **TCP/UDP protocols**. The goal is to ensure **efficient, collision-free data transmission** while handling **packet loss, out-of-order arrivals, and acknowledgments (ACKs)**.

### **Key Features**
âœ… **TDMA Slot Assignment** â€“ Sensors receive unique slots from the sink to avoid collisions.  
âœ… **Reliable Data Transmission** â€“ Uses TCP/UDP for communication.  
âœ… **Handling Out-of-Order Packets** â€“ Buffers and sorts data before processing.  
âœ… **Optional ACK Mechanism** â€“ Ensures message delivery and retransmissions if needed.  
âœ… **Scalability** â€“ Supports thousands of sensors communicating with a single sink.
